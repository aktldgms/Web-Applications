## Project Overview

The project consists of four main sections, each offering a visually appealing motorcycle-themed experience:

1. **Main Section:** At the top of the page, this section serves as an introductory header with a main image and text, immediately setting the motorcycle theme for visitors.

2. **Photo Gallery:** This gallery section displays various motorcycle images. The section title has a neon effect, fulfilling one of the project’s requirements.

3. **Contact Section:** At the bottom, there’s a contact form where users can (pretend to) enter their information. Behind the form is an aesthetic image of a motorcycle against a sunset, adding visual appeal to the page.

4. **Footer:** In the footer, there’s a scrolling text animation with a “All Rights Reserved” message. The text scrolls from right to left, disappearing off the screen before reappearing, in line with the assignment's animation requirement.

## Features and Effects

- **Neon Effects:** As required, two instances of neon effects were included in the project. One appears in the gallery section header, and the other as an RGB effect on the scroll bar.

- **Animations:** Although the assignment requested complex animations, a simpler approach was taken. A brief loading screen appears when the page first opens, giving a dynamic feel to the website. This screen is not functional in terms of loading any content but was added purely for visual effect.

- **Scrolling Text:** In the footer, the phrase “All Rights Reserved” scrolls from right to left across the screen, meeting the requirement for a scrolling animation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## Development Process

This project was created as part of a web development assignment to demonstrate basic skills in HTML and CSS and to meet specific design criteria. Simple methods were used to fulfill the neon and animation requirements, focusing more on meeting visual requirements than on functionality.
